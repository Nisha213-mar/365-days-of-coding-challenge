    <h1>Divs and Spans</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I'm inside a div!
            The Div is the most usable tag in web development because <strong>it helps us to separate out data in the web page</strong> and we can create
             a particular section for particular data or function in the web pages. It is used to the group of various tags of HTML so that
             sections can be created and style can be applied to them.
             <span>div is an HTML element that groups other elements of the page together. </span> is an attribute. All HTML elements can carry a class
              attribute. If your elements have a class attribute then you will be able to write a CSS rule to select that class. nav and container
             are names of classes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>This is div number 2!
        The span tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
         The span tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The span tag is much like 
        the div element, but div is a block-level element and span is an inline element.
