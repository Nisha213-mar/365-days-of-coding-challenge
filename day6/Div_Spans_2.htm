            I'm inside a div!
            The Div is the most usable tag in web development because <strong>it helps us to separate out data in the web page</strong> and we can create
             a particular section for particular data or function in the web pages.<span class="highlight"> It is used to the group of various tags of HTML so that
             sections can be created and style can be applied to them.</span>
             <span>div is an HTML element that groups other elements of the page together. </span> is an attribute. All HTML elements can carry a class
              attribute. If your elements have a class attribute then you will be able to write a CSS rule to select that class. nav and container
             are names of classes.

        The span tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.</span>
         The span tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The span tag is much like 
        the div element, but div is a block-level element and span is an inline element.
        What is the 'span' tag in HTML? <span class="accent-color">In HTML, the span tag is a generic inline container element.</span> Span tags usually wrap sections of 
        text for styling purposes or for adding attributes to a section of text without creating a new line of content
