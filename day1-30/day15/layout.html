    <h1>A BASIC LAYOUT</h1>
    <h2>This is my Section</h2>
    <p>An HTML layout is a blueprint used to arrange web pages in a well-defined manner. It is easy to navigate,
         simple to understand and uses HTML tags to customize web design elements. ... Additionally, because HTML
          layouts are typically responsive by default, they will also be properly formatted for mobile devicesv</p>
    <p>Layout is a very important aspect for any web site because a properly developed structure gives you a 
        good and airy look and it's intuitive and user-friendly with mobile devices (the site must be responsive, so
         it can be viewed correctly on all devices)</p>
