        If you say that something has a particular characteristic by its nature or by its very nature, you mean that things of that type always have that 
        characteristic. Peacekeeping, by its nature, makes pre-planning difficult.
        When I step out of the everyday world I find a fulfillment within myself. Going into nature and being surrounded by the wisdom of the trees, the beauty
         of the grasses, the inspiration of the mountains, and the warmth of the sun I can feel the subtle peace enter my body, mind, and spirit. I am now home
         once again.
